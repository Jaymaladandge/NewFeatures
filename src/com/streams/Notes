Stream

-Stream does not store elements. It simply conveys elements from a source such as a data structure, an array,
or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.
-Operations performed on a stream does not modify it's source. For example, filtering a Stream obtained from a collection
produces a new Stream without the filtered elements, rather than removing elements from the source collection.
-Stream is lazy and evaluates code only when required.-The elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of
a stream. Like an Iterator, a new stream must be generated to revisit the same elements of the source.
-You can use stream to filter, collect, print, and convert from one data structure to other etc.

- Java stream operations are divided into intermediate and terminal operations.
A stream pipeline consists of a stream source, followed by zero or more intermediate operations, and a terminal operation.

-Once the stream has been used or closed and if we try to use the same stream it will result in an exception.


Lazy Evaluation

-Computation on the source data is only performed when the terminal operation is initiated, and source elements are
consumed only as needed.
-All intermediate operations are lazy, so they’re not executed until a result of a processing is actually needed.


Java Stream Specializations
From what we discussed so far, Stream is a stream of object references. However, there are also the IntStream, LongStream,
and DoubleStream – which are primitive specializations for int, long and double respectively. These are quite convenient
when dealing with a lot of numerical primitives.

These specialized streams do not extend Stream but extend BaseStream on top of which Stream is also built.

As a consequence, not all operations supported by Stream are present in these stream implementations. For example,
the standard min() and max() take a comparator, whereas the specialized streams do not.

Specialized streams provide additional operations as compared to the standard Stream – which are quite convenient when
dealing with numbers. For example sum(), average(), range() etc



Reduction Operations

A reduction operation (also called as fold) takes a sequence of input elements and combines them into a single summary
result by repeated application of a combining operation. We already saw few reduction operations like findFirst(), min()
and max().
Sum, min, max, average, and string concatenation are all special cases of reduction.



Short Circuit Operations

Short-circuit operations provide performance benefits by avoiding unnecessary computations when the desired result can
be obtained early. They are particularly useful when working with large or infinite streams.
anyMatch(), findFirst()


map()

-An intermediate operation of the Stream API that is used to transform each element of the stream into another form.
used to process objects in a stream and produce a new stream with the processed objects.
-The transformation is done using a given function.
-The resulting stream will have the same number of elements as the original stream, but each element will have been
transformed by the provided function.
-Type Changes: The type of the elements in the resulting stream can be different from the type of the elements in the
original stream. For example, you can map a stream of integers to a stream of strings.



mapToObj()

-is part of the IntStream, LongStream, and DoubleStream classes.
-This method is used to map the elements of the stream to objects of a different type. returns an object-valued Stream
-It is especially useful when you want to transform a primitive stream (such as IntStream) to a stream of objects (Stream<T>).


Collectors.groupingBy()

-This method gives us a similar functionality to the "GROUP BY" statement in SQL.
-We use to group objects by a given specific property and store the end result in a map.

-Collectors.groupingBy(classifier) with a Classification Function
This method returns a Collector that groups the input elements according to the classification function, and returns
the result in a Map.
-Collectors.groupingBy(classifier,downstream) with a Classification Function and Downstream Collector
This method returns a Collector that groups the input elements to the classification function,
afterwards applying a reduction operation on the values associated with a given key using the specified downstream Collector.

-Collectors.mapping(mapper,downstream)
A mapper - a function to be applied to the input elements and
A downstream collector – a collector which will accept mapped values

-Collectors.groupingBy() with Collectors.counting()
reduction operations are very powerful and can be used to find the minimum, maximum, average, sums

-Collectors.groupingBy(classifier,mapFactory,downstream) with a Classification Function, Downstream Collector and Supplier
The only difference from earlier is that we've added another parameter mapFactory that specifies
the exact implementation of Map we want to use.



collect()

The collect method is a terminal operation of the Stream API that transforms the elements of a stream into a different
form, usually a collection such as a List, Set, or Map. The collect method takes a Collector as an argument,
which specifies how the elements of the stream should be collected.


    Integer[] empIds = { 1, 2, 3 };
    List<Employee> employees = Stream.of(empIds).map(employeeRepository::findById).collect(Collectors.toList());


findFirst()

-returns an Optional (a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value) describing
the first element of this stream, or an empty Optional if the stream is empty.

NullPointerException
-If a null element is chosen, then the NullPointerException is thrown.

NoSuchElementException
A java.util.NoSuchElementException is thrown if Stream.findFirst() fails to find an element, returning an empty Optional.
Before retrieving an element, it is recommended to always check if it is present by using Optional.isPresent().


distinct()
does not take any argument and returns the distinct elements in the stream, eliminating duplicates.
It uses the equals() method of the elements to decide whether two elements are equal or not
